* Changes to SVG class:
  - shouldn't have to pass an instance around just to be able to create/add elements
  - createElement should take an optional parent element
  - add Ivan's createEphemeralElement() (is removed automatically when rendered)

* Make FreehandTool's multi-stroke mode create a stroke group
