Constraints
-----------

* I'd like for the handle "break off" operation to work in this context:
  - Draw a stroke group.
  - Add a horizontal constraint to it.
  - Drag one of the handles on top of the other.
    (One will absorb the other.)
  - Now yank the sole handle. It'd like for it to
    break off, but that doesn't happen b/c of
    the constraints.
  (I don't expect this will be very difficult, but I wanted to write it
  here so that I don't lose track of it.)

* Give uncmin-based constraints a workout
  - diagram of the pythagorean theorem
    (does the order in which you draw the lines matter?)
  - formula constraints + scribble

* Add visualizations for the constraints
