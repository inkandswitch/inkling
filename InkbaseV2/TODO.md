Constraints
-----------

* Add a new VarPlusConstraint (a = b + c). It's *that*
  guy that will be used for angle constraints, along with
  FixedValueConstraint for the difference.

* Give uncmin-based constraints a workout
  - diagram of the pythagorean theorem
    (does the order in which you draw the lines matter?)
  - formula constraints + scribble

* Add visualizations for the constraints
